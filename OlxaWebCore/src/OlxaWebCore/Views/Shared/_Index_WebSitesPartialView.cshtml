                    Effectively catches all viruses. Our Antivirus includes Behavioural Detection, which spots new viruses because of the actions they take on your computer and stops them before they can do damage. Together with Signature-based Detection, which identifies
                    the 'signatures' of known malware, you gain a multi-layered defence system for your PC that's virtually impenetrable.
                    <br />
                    <br />Top detection rates of viruses and malware have been proven by independent labs.
